# Post-Earthquake Recovery under Human Resource Constraints
Supplemental Materials for the Paper "Modelling Post-Earthquake Building Recovery Under Human Resource Constraints"

This script executes the Dynamic Stochastic Queuing (DSQ) model to capture the temporal impacts of human resource constraints on building recovery timeframes following earthquakes. The code was developed by Lianyan Li, and the underlying calculations are based on the following publication:

Li, L., Chang-Richards, A., et al. (2025). Modelling post-earthquake building recovery under human resource constraints. International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.

To run this script, three additional files are required: two Excel files (BuildingSamples.xlsx and HR_Mobilisation.xlsx) and one Python module (Dynamic Stochastic Queuing model.py) that provide the supporting models for the main script.
