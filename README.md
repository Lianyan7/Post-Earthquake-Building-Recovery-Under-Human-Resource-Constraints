# Post-Earthquake Building Recovery Under Human Resource Constraints
Supplemental Materials for the Paper ***"Modelling Post-Earthquake Building Recovery Under Human Resource Constraints"***

This repository provides the Python code implementing the **Dynamic Stochastic Queuing (DSQ)** model, which quantifies the temporal impacts of human resource constraints on building recovery following earthquakes. The code was developed by Lianyan Li and is based on the methodologies described in the following publication:

Li, L., Chang-Richards, A., et al. (2025). *Modelling post-earthquake building recovery under human resource constraints*. International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.

To run this script, three additional files are required: two Excel files (BuildingSamples.xlsx and HR_Mobilisation.xlsx) and one Python module (Dynamic Stochastic Queuing model.py) that provide the supporting models for the main script.

These supporting files provide the necessary sample data and model definitions required by the main script. This repository is intended for academic and professional use and contributes to advancing the understanding of post-disaster recovery processes under human resource constraints.
